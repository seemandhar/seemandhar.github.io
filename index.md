## About Me

I am Seemandhar Jain — a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego, advised by Dr. Manmohan Chandraker. My research sits at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and 3D vision: I build LLM-guided multi-agent systems and generative models that enable 3D-aware scene understanding and synthesis. My recent work focuses on automating the conversion of NeRF research into executable code and on diffusion-based 3D/4D generation with improved geometric consistency.
