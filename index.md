## About Me

I am Seemandhar Jain, a Master of Science student at the Department of Computer Science, working under the guidance of Professor David Forsyth in the realm of computer vision. My research is chiefly centered around the convex decomposition of indoor images and intrinsic image decomposition, with an overarching aim to harness the power of computer vision to foster significant advancements in healthcare.

I earned my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Indore, India. Over time, I have had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed professors from globally recognized institutions like IMT Atlantique, the University of Witwatersrand, IITI, and the University of Alberta. My work has garnered attention and been featured in numerous top-tier conferences and journals. Additionally, I co-founded a modest tech venture, HealthAIgnite, which serves as a platform to display my innovative research intersecting healthcare and computer vision.

In the past, I have held positions as a research intern at Docomo Innovations and as a software developer at Salesforce. My journey extends beyond academics and professional strides; I have been an International Mathematics Olympiad rank holder, a UCMAS Scholar, and an ACM ICPC qualifier. My commitment to community service has led to my involvement with various NGOs, earning me the Young Philanthropist Award from the state of Madhya Pradesh, India.
