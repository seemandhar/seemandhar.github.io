## About Me

I am Seemandhar Jain, a PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of California San Diego](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mkchandraker/), advised by [Prof. Manmohan Chandraker](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mkchandraker/). I work at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and 3D vision, with a focus on multi-agent systems for 3D scene understanding, reconstruction, and generation; NeRFs; and diffusion models for 3D-aware image/video synthesis.

Previously, I completed my MS in Computer Science at the [University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) (GPA 3.92/4), advised by [Prof. David Forsyth](http://luthuli.cs.uiuc.edu/~daf/), where I worked on single-shot 3D reconstruction, convex decomposition, intrinsic image decomposition and relighting with diffusion models, and 2D-to-3D transformations. I am a [Siebel Scholar, Class of 2024](https://www.siebelscholars.com/).

I graduated with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Indore](https://www.iiti.ac.in/). I founded [HealthAIgnite](http://healthaignite.com/), a healthcare AI consulting company focused on computer vision. I have also worked with industry research and product teams, including Google (Student Researcher, BigML), Aireal (Research Scientist, CV), DOCOMO Innovations (Research Intern), and Salesforce (AMTS, AI).
